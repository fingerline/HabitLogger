# Habit Logger

This is a small console application that interacts with a SQLite database to track the occurrances of a habit across a number of days.

The habit logger must:

- [x] Create a database (with a table) if one isn't present,
- [x] Provide the user with a menu of options,
- [x] Allow the user to insert records for a day (in the form of DATE, NUMBER OF OCCURANCES)
- [x] Allow the user to update existing records for a day
- [x] Allow the user to delete existing records for a day
- [x] Allow the user to view all existing records
- [x] Only terminate when the user inputs "exit" as a menu command.
